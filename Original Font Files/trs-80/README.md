Tandy TRS-80 fonts
==================

This directory contains fonts for the TRS-80 Model 1, Model III/4/4P, Color Computer 1/2 & Color Computer 3.
These were supplied with David Keil's TRS-80/Tandy Computer Emulators, archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20070702190709/http://discover-net.net/~dmkeil/.

The MC6847 fonts are extracted from the MAME source code. While the CoCo used Motorola MC6847 character generators, these fonts are different from the TRS-80 
fronts by David Keil. A 'modified' MC6847T1 was used in the CoCo3; the font displayed in the MC6847T1 datasheet is different again.

These fonts are extracted from the XRoar emulator source code.
