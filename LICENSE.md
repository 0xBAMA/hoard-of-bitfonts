Copyrights
----------

It is my understanding that:  

- In the USA, bitmap typefaces are not copyrightable.  
- In the UK, the 25-year term of copyright for these typefaces has expired.  

However, you should ensure that you have the right to copy and use these typefaces in your jurisdiction.  


Licensing
---------

Notwithstanding the above, in several cases explicit licensing terms were provided.
Please refer to the individual sources and directories for such terms.  

Insofar as I have created copyrightable work by representing these typefaces in their present form:
to the extent possible under law, I waive all copyright
and related or neighbouring rights to that additional work under the
[Creative Commons Zero dedication](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
