Bitmap fonts for humans
-----------------------

This repository contains bitmapped fonts from various sources, in human-readable text format.

The plain-text `.draw` format is a generalisation of [Roman Czyborra's hexdraw format](http://czyborra.com/unifont/), in that:
- I use it to store fonts of all sizes (in the obvious way)  
- The code points can be those of the original character set, rather than unicode
