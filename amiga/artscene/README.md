Amiga artscene fonts
====================

The Amiga bitmap fonts in this directory were extracted from the raw versions at Marcus Hoffren's Github repo https://github.com/rewtnull/amigafonts.

These fonts have been stretched to 8x16 so that they reproduce the Amiga's aspect ratio on modern platforms. 
However, they appear also to have been edited afterwards as not all of them can cleanly be shrunk to 8x8.
